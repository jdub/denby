Denby
=====

Welcome! Consider yourself warned. :-)

## Denby

Web client application (not included in the repository just yet).

## Proxy (per-client)

Socket.IO (and JSON-RPC-over-SIO) interface between Denby and Ripley.

## Ripley (singular)

Twitter user/site streams manager and future destination for all the cool 'cloud' features.

Mostly ignored at this point, as the recently refactored Proxy is just making its own userstreams connection for now. Ripley will again be responsible for all stream management once the sitestreams work is merged in.
